# MVC Architecture

## âœ… Purpose of MVC Architecture

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software architectural pattern used to:

- **Organize Code**: Separates the codebase into three logical components.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ensures that UI, business logic, and data management are handled independently.
- **Improve Maintainability**: Enables easier updates and debugging.
- **Support Multiple Views**: The same data can be represented in different UI layouts.
- **Facilitate Testing**: Clear separation allows easier unit and integration testing.

## ðŸ§© Components of MVC

| Component     | Responsibility                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model**     | Handles data, business logic, and rules (e.g., API, DB access, calculations).  |
| **View**      | Displays the UI, rendering data from the model (e.g., HTML, XML layouts).       |
| **Controller**| Receives user input, interacts with model, updates the view.                   |

## ðŸ“Œ Where It's Used

- **Web Applications**: Django, Rails, ASP.NET MVC
- **Desktop Apps**: Java Swing, .NET
- **Mobile Apps**: Android (legacy apps), iOS

---

## ðŸ“± Example (Android)

1. **User clicks Login button** (View)
2. **Controller** receives the event, processes it.
3. **Model** validates login credentials.
4. **Controller** updates the View with the result.

## âœ… Summary

MVC helps in organizing applications efficiently by dividing responsibilities across:
- **Model (data)**,
- **View (UI)**, and
- **Controller (logic)**.

This architecture improves **maintainability, testability, and scalability**.
