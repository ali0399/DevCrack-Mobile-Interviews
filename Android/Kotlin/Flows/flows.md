# Kotlin Flows

Kotlin Flows are a part of Kotlin Coroutines and provide a way to handle streams of asynchronous data.

## Key Concepts

- **Flow**: Represents a cold asynchronous stream of values.
- **Cold Stream**: The flow does not emit data until it is collected.
- **Operators**: Functions like `map`, `filter`, `take`, etc., to transform flows.
- **Collector**: Consumes the values emitted by the flow.

## Basic Example

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking

fun simpleFlow(): Flow<Int> = flow {
    for (i in 1..3) {
        emit(i)
    }
}

fun main() = runBlocking {
    simpleFlow().collect { value ->
        println(value)
    }
}
```

## Common Operators

- `map { }` – Transform each value.
- `filter { }` – Filter values.
- `take(n)` – Take first n values.
- `collect { }` – Terminal operator to receive values.

## Use Cases

- Asynchronous data streams (e.g., network responses, database updates)
- Reactive UI updates
- Event handling

## Common Interview Questions on Kotlin Flows (with Answers)

1. **What is the difference between Flow and LiveData?**  
    *Flow is a cold asynchronous stream from Kotlin Coroutines, suitable for both UI and non-UI layers, and supports operators and backpressure. LiveData is lifecycle-aware, designed for UI, and does not support operators or backpressure.*

2. **How does Flow handle backpressure?**  
    *Flow is cold and suspends the producer if the consumer is slow, naturally handling backpressure by suspending emission until the collector is ready.*

3. **Explain cold vs hot streams in the context of Flow.**  
    *Cold streams (like Flow) start emitting values only when collected, and each collector gets its own emissions. Hot streams (like SharedFlow, StateFlow) emit values regardless of collectors, and multiple collectors share emissions.*

4. **What are some common Flow operators and their use cases?**  
    *Operators like `map`, `filter`, `take`, `flatMapConcat`, and `debounce` are used to transform, filter, limit, combine, or debounce emissions from a Flow.*

5. **How do you handle exceptions in a Flow?**  
    *Use the `catch` operator to handle exceptions upstream, or try-catch blocks inside the flow builder for emission errors.*

6. **What is the difference between `flow`, `channelFlow`, and `stateFlow`?**  
    - `flow`: Basic cold stream builder.
    - `channelFlow`: Allows concurrent emissions from multiple coroutines.
    - `stateFlow`: Hot, state-holder observable flow, always has a current value.

7. **How can you combine multiple flows?**  
    *Use operators like `zip`, `combine`, or `flatMapMerge` to merge or combine emissions from multiple flows.*

8. **How does Flow cancellation work?**  
    *Flow is cancellable; if the coroutine collecting the flow is cancelled, the flow stops emitting and cleans up resources.*

9. **What is the role of `collect` in Flow?**  
    *`collect` is a terminal operator that triggers the flow to start emitting values and processes each emitted value.*

10. **How do you test Flows in unit tests?**  
     *Use libraries like Turbine or run test coroutines with `runBlockingTest` to collect and assert emissions from a Flow.*
    ## Sample Code Interview Snippets (with Answers)

    ### 1. Collecting Flow Values

    **Question:** How do you collect values from a Flow and print them?

    ```kotlin
    val numbers = flowOf(1, 2, 3)
    numbers.collect { value ->
        println(value)
    }
    ```
    *This collects and prints each value emitted by the flow.*

    ### 2. Using Flow Operators

    **Question:** How do you use `map` and `filter` operators on a Flow?

    ```kotlin
    val flow = flowOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    flow
        .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
        .map { it * it }
        .collect { println(it) }
    ```
    *This filters even numbers and prints their squares.*

    ### 3. Exception Handling in Flows

    **Question:** How do you handle exceptions in a Flow?

    ```kotlin
    flow {
        emit(1)
        throw RuntimeException("Error!")
    }.catch { e ->
        emit(-1)
    }.collect { println(it) }
    ```
    *This emits 1, then catches the exception and emits -1.*

    ---

    ### 4. Combining Flows

    **Question:** How do you combine two flows?

    ```kotlin
    val flow1 = flowOf(1, 2)
    val flow2 = flowOf("A", "B")
    flow1.zip(flow2) { a, b -> "$a$b" }
        .collect { println(it) }
    ```
    *This combines emissions to print "1A" and "2B".*

    ---

    ### 5. Using StateFlow

    **Question:** How do you use StateFlow to hold and observe state?

    ```kotlin
    val stateFlow = MutableStateFlow(0)
    stateFlow.value = 5
    stateFlow.collect { println(it) }
    ```
    *This holds a state and emits updates to collectors.*
