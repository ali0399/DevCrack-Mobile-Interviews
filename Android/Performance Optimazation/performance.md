# Android App Performance Optimization: Common Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What are the key areas to focus on for Android app performance optimization?
**Answer:**  
- Memory usage (avoid leaks, use efficient data structures)
- UI rendering (smooth scrolling, avoid overdraw)
- Network calls (batch requests, use caching)
- Battery consumption (optimize background tasks, use JobScheduler/WorkManager)
- App startup time (lazy loading, minimize onCreate work)

## 2. How do you detect and fix memory leaks in Android?
**Answer:**  
- Use tools like Android Profiler, LeakCanary
- Avoid holding references to Context in static fields
- Unregister listeners and callbacks
- Use WeakReference where appropriate

## 3. What is overdraw and how can you reduce it?
**Answer:**  
- Overdraw happens when the same pixel is drawn multiple times in a single frame
- Use the "Show GPU Overdraw" tool in Developer Options
- Flatten view hierarchies, use background only where needed, avoid unnecessary nesting

## 4. How can you optimize RecyclerView performance?
**Answer:**  
- Use ViewHolder pattern
- Use DiffUtil for list updates
- Set fixed size if possible (`setHasFixedSize(true)`)
- Use appropriate layout managers

## 5. How do you improve app startup time?
**Answer:**  
- Defer heavy initialization (lazy loading)
- Use SplashScreen API for smoother transitions
- Avoid blocking the main thread in `onCreate()`
- Use background threads for non-UI work

## 6. How do you optimize network usage in Android apps?
**Answer:**  
- Use efficient data formats (e.g., JSON over XML)
- Implement caching (OkHttp, Retrofit)
- Compress data before sending
- Batch network requests when possible

## 7. What tools do you use for profiling and monitoring app performance?
**Answer:**  
- Android Profiler (CPU, Memory, Network)
- Systrace
- LeakCanary
- StrictMode
- Firebase Performance Monitoring

## 8. How do you minimize battery drain in your app?
**Answer:**  
- Schedule background tasks efficiently (WorkManager, JobScheduler)
- Use location updates wisely (set appropriate intervals)
- Avoid wake locks unless necessary
- Batch operations to minimize wakeups

## 9. What is StrictMode and how does it help?
**Answer:**  
- StrictMode is a developer tool to catch accidental disk/network access on the main thread and memory leaks
- Helps identify and fix performance bottlenecks during development

## 10. How do you handle large images efficiently in Android?
**Answer:**  
- Use libraries like Glide or Picasso for image loading and caching
- Downsample images to required size
- Use Bitmap recycling and avoid loading full-size images into memory

## 11. How do you optimize database operations in Android?
**Answer:**  
- Use indexing and optimized queries
- Prefer asynchronous operations (Room with coroutines/RxJava)
- Use transactions for batch operations
- Minimize main thread database access

## 12. How do you profile and optimize rendering performance in complex UI screens?
**Answer:**  
- Use Layout Inspector and Profile GPU Rendering tools
- Minimize nested layouts and use ConstraintLayout
- Reuse views and avoid unnecessary view invalidations
- Optimize custom views and drawing code

## 13. What strategies do you use for efficient background processing?
**Answer:**  
- Use WorkManager for deferrable, guaranteed background work
- Use foreground services only when necessary
- Schedule tasks based on device state (charging, network)
- Cancel unnecessary or duplicate tasks

## 14. How do you ensure smooth scrolling in lists with images or complex items?
**Answer:**  
- Use image loading libraries with placeholders and caching
- Preload data and images when possible
- Avoid heavy computations in `onBindViewHolder`
- Use RecyclerViewâ€™s built-in optimizations

## 15. How do you monitor and improve ANR (Application Not Responding) rates?
**Answer:**  
- Analyze ANR traces from Play Console or logcat
- Move heavy operations off the main thread
- Optimize broadcast receivers and content providers
- Use watchdogs and timeouts for long-running tasks


## 16. How do you optimize APK size in Android apps?
**Answer:**  
- Remove unused resources and code (ProGuard/R8)
- Use Android App Bundles for dynamic delivery
- Compress images and assets
- Avoid unnecessary libraries and dependencies
- Use vector drawables where possible

## 17. What are best practices for thread management in Android?
**Answer:**  
- Use Executors, HandlerThread, or coroutines for background work
- Avoid creating excessive threads
- Clean up threads and tasks to prevent leaks
- Use main thread only for UI updates

## 18. How do you ensure security without compromising performance?
**Answer:**  
- Use encrypted storage efficiently (e.g., EncryptedSharedPreferences)
- Minimize cryptographic operations on the main thread
- Use network security configuration for secure connections
- Avoid storing sensitive data in memory longer than needed

## 19. How do you handle configuration changes efficiently?
**Answer:**  
- Use ViewModel to retain UI data
- Save and restore state using onSaveInstanceState
- Use resource qualifiers for layouts and assets
- Avoid heavy operations in Activity recreation

## 20. How do you test app performance across different devices?
**Answer:**  
- Use Firebase Test Lab or physical device farms
- Test on a range of API levels and hardware specs
- Automate performance tests with Espresso or UI Automator
- Monitor real-world performance with analytics and crash reporting tools
